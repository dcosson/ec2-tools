## EC2 Experiments

A couple of quick bash scripts to set up EC2 boxes the way I like them.  The idea is to get the boxes to a state where I can run puppet manifests on them (e.g. I set the hostname for facter to work with).

Mostly just for learning purposes and so I'll remember the commands later.
